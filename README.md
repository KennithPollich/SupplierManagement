# Confidential Supplier Management System

A privacy-preserving supplier management platform built on blockchain technology with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) capabilities.

## üîí Core Concepts

### FHE Smart Contracts
This platform leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to protect sensitive supplier information while maintaining functionality. The smart contract enables:

- **Encrypted Rating System**: Supplier quality ratings (1-10) are encrypted using FHE, allowing computations without revealing actual values
- **Privacy-Preserving Comparisons**: Compare supplier ratings without exposing the underlying scores
- **Selective Data Access**: Only authorized parties can decrypt sensitive information
- **On-chain Privacy**: Sensitive data remains encrypted even when stored on the public blockchain

### Confidential Supplier Management

The system provides comprehensive privacy protection for supplier information:

#### üîê Privacy-Protected Supplier Information
- **Encrypted Quality Ratings**: Supplier performance scores are encrypted and can only be decrypted by authorized owners
- **Selective Information Disclosure**: Public information (name, category, contact) remains accessible while sensitive data stays protected
- **Owner-Only Access**: Rating decryption and preference status are restricted to data owners
- **Secure Updates**: All sensitive data modifications maintain encryption integrity

**GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/KennithPollich/SupplierManagement](https://github.com/KennithPollich/SupplierManagement)

## üìã Features

### Smart Contract Capabilities
- **Add Suppliers**: Register new suppliers with encrypted rating information
- **Update Ratings**: Modify supplier ratings while maintaining encryption
- **Compare Suppliers**: Privacy-preserving rating comparisons using FHE operations
- **Preference Management**: Set and update preferred supplier status
- **Secure Queries**: Retrieve supplier information with privacy controls

### Security & Privacy
- **FHE Encryption**: Utilizes Zama's FHE library for on-chain privacy
- **Access Control**: Owner-based permission system for sensitive operations
- **Async Decryption**: Secure rating decryption through callback mechanisms
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event system for tracking operations

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Structure
```solidity
contract SupplierManagement {
    struct Supplier {
        string name;           // Public
        string category;       // Public
        string contact;        // Public
        euint8 rating;         // FHE Encrypted
        bool isPreferred;      // Owner-only access
        address owner;         // Public
        bool exists;           // Public
    }
}
```
